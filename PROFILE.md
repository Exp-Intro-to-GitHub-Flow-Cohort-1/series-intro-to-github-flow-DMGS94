# 👋 Hello, I'm Your Name!

## 🌟 About Me
Hey there! I'm a seasoned EPLAN consultant from the beautiful Portugal 🇵🇹, diving into the tech world for 7 years and counting. My coding adventure began in the realms of EPLAN, where the magic of automating processes through scripts caught my eye. 🚀

I didn't stop there! My curiosity led me on a quest for knowledge, exploring the depths of programming through platforms like freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and a treasure trove of YouTube videos and books. 📚 In 2022, I took a leap into Multimedia Engineering, juggling studies and work but fueled by my ever-growing passion for programming, especially in the fascinating worlds of AI 🤖 and machine learning. 🧠

## 💻 My Projects
I've crafted some cool projects along the way:
- **Web Wizardry:** Conjured a WebPage with the spells of HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript. ✨
- **C# Concoctions:** Brewed some robust apps with CRUD functionalities, mastering the art of OOP. 🛠️
- **Full-Stack Fantasia:** Wove a PHP webpage intricately linked with SQL (mysqli & pdo), all dressed up in Bootstrap fashion. 🌐
- **Gameplay Galore:** Unleashed a spaceship game, blending JavaScript, P5.js, and a sprinkle of machine learning mystery. 🚀
- **SQL Saga:** Orchestrated a complete MySQL project, breathing life into a courses website. 📊

## 🎯 Future Aspirations
Onward in my Multimedia Engineering voyage, I aim to delve deeper into AI's enigma and machine learning's marvels, aspiring to contribute to groundbreaking projects. 🌍
